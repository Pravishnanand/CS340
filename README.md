**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs is essential in software development. When working on the CRUD Python module for Project One and integrating it into the dashboard for Project Two, I followed best practices to achieve these goals. I used clear and meaningful variable and function names, added comments to explain complex logic, and organized the code into modular functions. This made it easier to understand, maintain, and adapt the code over time. The advantages of this approach were evident in the dashboard project, as I could seamlessly connect the widgets to the database using the CRUD module without making significant code changes. In the future, I can reuse this CRUD module for other projects involving database operations, saving time and ensuring consistency in data access and manipulation.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. When tackling the requirements set by Grazioso Salvare for the database and dashboard, I first identified the key functionalities needed, such as data filtering, visualization, and interactivity. I then designed a modular architecture that separated concerns, making it easier to implement and test individual features. This project differed from previous assignments by involving real-world client requirements and data. To meet future client requests for databases, I would employ a similar approach, starting with clear requirements, designing a suitable database schema, and implementing robust data management and visualization components.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists play a crucial role in solving complex problems through technology. In this project, my work helped Grazioso Salvare by providing them with a data-driven dashboard that facilitates efficient management and decision-making related to rescue dogs. Computer scientists design solutions that improve data accuracy, accessibility, and usability, enabling companies like Grazioso Salvare to make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and achieve their mission more efficiently. This project demonstrates the importance of computer science in enhancing the operations of organizations and making a positive impact on their work.
